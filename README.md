# PowerPlantEngineeringReviewerGame
this is a HTML of a gamified reviewer for my Power Plant Engineering class. I made this so that I could review formulas easily using somewhat-stimulating game mechanics to aid in memory retention. Before you know it, you'd have mastered the formulas you need for class. 

You can also use the code and edit the contents to your liking.  Just look for 'const formulas = { };' and you'll see a list of formulas there. The format is, "Formula Name": ["Formula variation 1", "Formula variation 2"] 

Just make sure theres a ',' at the end of the previous listed formula before you add a new one.
